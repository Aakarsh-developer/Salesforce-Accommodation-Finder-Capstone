- Property availability, pricing, and amenities are not transparent.  
- There‚Äôs no proper request tracking for booking, complaints, or cancellations.  
- Support agents manually assign cases leading to delays.  
- Managers lack visibility into demand trends, property occupancy rates, and service quality.  

The company wants a **Salesforce CRM solution** to:  
- Automate booking and complaint management.

- Provide real-time notifications (SMS/Email) to students.  
- Offer a **self-service portal** for students to search and request rooms.
