# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis  

## 1. Problem Statement  
Students who move to new cities for higher education face major challenges in finding safe, affordable, and reliable accommodation. They often depend on brokers, unverified listings, or informal channels, which leads to issues such as high rents, lack of security, and misinformation.  
The **Student Accommodation Finder** project aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized Salesforce-based platform that connects students with verified landlords, enabling transparency and ease of access.  



## 2. Requirement Gathering  

### Functional Requirements  
- Students should be able to register and create profiles.  
- Students can search for rooms/hostels/PGs by city, price, facilities, and availability.  
- Landlords can register and list their rooms with details like rent, location, and facilities.  
- A booking system should allow students to request rooms.  
- Admin should approve and monitor listings.  
- Notifications (email/SMS) should be sent for bookings and approvals.  

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- Data security: Only authorized users can access data.  
- Performance: Search results should load quickly.  
- Usability: Interface should be simple for students and landlords.  
- Scalability: System should support multiple cities and thousands of listings.  



## 3. Stakeholder Analysis  

| Stakeholder     | Role in the System                                | Needs/Expectations                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Students**    | End users who search and book accommodation       | Easy search, affordable options, safety info |
| **Landlords**   | Provide rooms/PGs/hostels                         | Platform to list rooms and find tenants      |
| **Admin**       | Manages platform operations and approvals         | Control over data, monitor activities        |
| **Colleges**    | Optional stakeholders for future integration      | Verified housing options for students        |



## 4. Business Process Mapping  

**Step 1:** Student registers on the platform.  
**Step 2:** Student searches available rooms using filters (location, price, facilities).  
**Step 3:** Student selects a room and places a booking request.  
**Step 4:** Landlord receives notification and confirms availability.  
**Step 5:** Admin verifies and approves booking (if required).  
**Step 6:** Student receives confirmation email/SMS.  
**Step 7:** Feedback/complaint system allows students to rate their experience.  



## 5. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis  

- **Education Industry:** Colleges want reliable housing solutions for their students.  
- **Real Estate Industry:** Property owners get a new market (students) without brokers.  
- **Technology/CRM Industry:** Salesforce provides a scalable, secure, and customizable platform for managing student-owner interactions.  

This project combines **EdTech + PropTech (Property Tech)** use cases.  



## 6. AppExchange Exploration  

Before custom development, we explored Salesforce AppExchange to check for existing solutions:  

- **Property Management Apps:** Designed for large-scale real estate companies, not student-focused.  
- **Rental Management Apps:** Expensive and more suited for commercial leasing.  
- **Education Apps:** Focused on learning, not accommodation.  

ðŸ‘‰ Conclusion: No AppExchange app currently solves this exact student accommodation problem, hence a **custom Salesforce solution** is required.  



## 7. Phase 1 Outcomes  

- Problem clearly defined: Lack of centralized, verified housing for students.  
- Requirements documented (functional + non-functional).  
- Stakeholders identified and mapped.  
- Business process flow created.  
- Industry gap validated (no direct AppExchange solution).
